## DevOps Philosophy

<div align="center">

### My Core Principles

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Automate Everything** | If you do it twice, automate it |
| **Observability First** | You can't improve what you can't measure |
| **Continuous Improvement** | Small iterations lead to big wins |
| **Security by Default** | Security isn't a feature, it's a requirement |
| **Document Everything** | Today's documentation is tomorrow's time saver |
| **Collaborate & Share** | Knowledge grows when shared |
